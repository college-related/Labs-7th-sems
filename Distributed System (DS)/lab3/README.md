# Lab 3

## Objective

- To implement a java RMI (Remote Method Invocation)

## Theory

- Client Server communication is a type of communication that consists of a server that host the communication and client that is connected to the server in some port.
- Remote Method Invocation, it is a Java API that allows an object to invoke methods on an object running in another Java Virtual Machine (JVM), possibly on a different host. RMI is a powerful feature of the Java platform that allows Java objects to invoke methods of remote objects as if they were local objects.
